                    We know that

                    * Total Functions are good
                    * Pure Functions are good
                    * Referential Transparency is good

                    but ...

                    How do we write a useful program if we do not have side-effect?

                    If we dont have them, we cannot even print to std!
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    How can we model side-effectful computations, using Scala type system?
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Suppose, we have a special type World, that would include a snapshot of the real world with everything that exists:

                    ```scala
                    // Type alias - just renaming
                    type World
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    How then would a function that makes a side-effect look like?

                    What signature will it have?

                    For example, what signature will function writing to console have? reading from console?
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Take a snapshot of the world as an argument

                    Extract console from the world,

                    and put there a new line

                    Returning a new snapshot of the world
                    
                    ```scala
                    def putStrLn(world: World, input: String): World = ???
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Now, let's write program using these functions:
                    ```scala
                    def program(world: World): World = {
                        val (newWorld: World, stranger: String) =
                          readStlLn(world)
                        val greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                        putStrLn(world, greeting)
                      }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Now, all we have to do is creating a instance of World

                    However, we cannot do that

                    Let's rewrite our program without actually mentioning the World explicitly
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    def putStrLn(input: String): World => World = ???
                    def readStrLn: World => (World, String) = ???
                    
                    def program: World => World = { world =>
                        val (newWorld: World, stranger: String) =
                            readStlLn(world)
                        val greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                            putStrLn(greeting)(world)
                    }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    We still are using world as an argument inside our program.

                    Let's define a new type that will hide it

                    ```scala
                    type WithSideEffect[A] = World => (World, A)
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    object WithSideEffect {
                        def pure[A](a: A): WithSideEffect[A] =
                          world => (world, a)
                       
                        def flatMap[A, B](
                          fa: WithSideEffect[A],
                          f: A => WithSideEffect[B]
                        ): WithSideEffect[B] = { world =>
                          val (newWorld, res) = fa(world)
                          f(res)(newWorld)
                        }
                        // ...
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    // ...
                    def map[A, B](
                        fa: WithSideEffect[A],
                        f: A => B
                    ): WithSideEffect[B] =
                        flatMap[A, B](fa, f.andThen(pure[B]))
                    }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Let's use define our program through map and flatMap:

                    ```scala
                    def putStrLn(input: String): WithSideEffect[Unit] = ???
                    def readStrLn: WithSideEffect[String] = ???
                     
                    def program: WithSideEffect[Unit] = {
                      readStrLn.flatMap { stranger =>
                        val greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                        putStrLn(greeting)
                      }
                    }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Scala has special syntax called for-comprehension to make several nested flatMap and map calls readable

                    It allows writing programs in imperative style
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    def program: WithSideEffect[Unit] =
                        for {
                            stranger <- readStrLn
                            // Local variable - same as val
                            greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                            _ <- putStrLn(stranger)
                        } yield ()
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    We erased all mentions of the World type

                    However, our program (type WithSideEffect) is still just a function

                    It does not do anything useful, unless we explicitly call it
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    We need something to run it. Suppose we have an alternative entrypoint:

                    ```scala
                    def run(args: Array[String]): WithSideEffect[Unit] =
                        program
                    
                   def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
                    // somehow calling run(args)
                   }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    This function is called the end of the world

                    It represents a boundary between pure programs and its impure runtime

                    Side-effects in this setting are evaluated somewhere where end of the world is called

                    Thus, in our code we only operate with pure functions and referentially transparent expressions
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    def programTwo: WithSideEffect[Unit] =
                        for {
                            stranger <- readStrLn
                            greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                            _ <- putStrLn(greeting)
                            _ <- putStrLn(greeting)
                            _ <- putStrLn(greeting)
                        } yield ()
                    // Printing 3 times: Hello, $stranger
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    def programThree: WithSideEffect[Unit] =
                    for {
                      stranger <- readStrLn
                      greeting: String = s"Hello, $stranger"
                      print = putStrLn(greeting)
                      _ <- print
                      _ <- print
                      _ <- print
                    } yield ()
                  // Printing 3 times: Hello, $stranger                  
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Everytime we see that function returns WithSideEffect, we know that this function will make a side-effect during evaluation

                    We explicitly declare side-effects this way, while maintaining purity and referential transparency                  
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Moreover, if we call such function, we don't have a choice - we must return WithSideEffect in our function

                    ```scala
                    def complexComputation: WithSideEffect[BigDecimal] = ???
                    def pureLogic(from: BigDecimal): String = ???
                     
                    def myProgram: WithSideEffect[String] =
                      map(complexComputation, pureLogic)                    
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Side-effects in such notation can contain anything: reading from console, saving data in database, calling another service through HTTP

                    We still should separate our business logic in functions that do not return WithSideEffect in order to maintain Local Reasoning
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Local Reasoning - ability to think about correctness of the function locally, using only its signature and body
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Overall concept of declaring computations with side-effects is called IO monad

                    ```scala 
                      type IO[A] = WithSideEffect[A]
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Scala ecosystem has several implementations of such concept:

                    * cats.effect.IO
                    * monix.Task
                    * zio.ZIO
                    ```
                </section>

                    Laziness
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Scala has several built in mechanisms for lazy evaluation

                    First - lazy val. They are evaluated only when they are first called
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    lazy val later: Int = {
                        println("One")
                        1
                      }
                      println("Two")
                      println(s"Three $later")
                      println(s"Four $later")
                       
                      // std.out: "Two"
                      //          "One"
                      //          "Three 1"
                      //          "Four 1"                      
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Second mechanism - by-name argument pass:

                    ```scala
                    @tailrec
                    def whileLoop(condition: => Boolean)(action: => Unit): Unit =
                        if (condition) {
                            action
                            whileLoop(condition)(action)
                        }
                    ```

                    => arguments will be evaluated each time they are called

                    Special type for function: () => T

                        def impureCompute(): T

                    putStrLn("Hello, world!")  // does nothing
                    putStrLn("Hello, world!").impureCompute() // prints

                    putStrLn("Hello, world!")  // does nothing
                    putStrLn("Hello, world!").impureCompute() // prints
                    
                    ```

                    This definition holds the referential transparency
                    ```scala
                    val a = putStrLn("Hello, world!")
                    a
                    a

                    putStrLn("Hello, world!")
                    putStrLn("Hello, world!")
                    ```

                    And both do nothing

                    This type is often called a suspended computation

                    It is lazy, because it does not start at the moment of its creation, but only when it is explicitly started.

                    Unlike lazy val, these computations are not memoized and repeat on each invocation.

                    impureCompute invocations are usually limited to only a few places in the program.

                    Is this a pure function?
                    ```scala
                    def readln(): String = scala.io.StdIn.readLine()

                    }
                    ```

                    This is a val instead of a def, is it correct? Why?

                    Each pure computation can be lifted to an impure one:

                    ```scala
                    def add(l: Int, r: Int): Int = l + r
 
                    def impureAdd(l: Int, r: Int): IO[Int] = {
                      val res = add(l, r)
                      () => res
                    }
                     
                    def deferredAdd(l: Int, r: Int): IO[Int] =
                      { () => add(l, r) }
                    ```

                    What is the difference between impureAdd and deferredAdd?

                    Generally, putting a value T into IO[T] is done by function pure:

                        def pure[T](value: T): IO[T] =
                          { () => value }

                    val strings = List("Hello", "World")
                    ```
                    How do we print all these strings sequentially using putStrLn, flatMap and recursion?

                    traverse combinator is analogous to foreach and map methods on lists.

                    ```scala
                    def traverse[T, O](
                        list: List[T],
                        computation: T => IO[O],
                        ): IO[List[O]] =
                        list match {
                            case x :: xs =>
                                for {
                                    res <- computation(x)
                                    resRest <- traverse(xs, computation)
                                } yield res :: resRest
                            case Nil => Computation.pure(Nil)
                        }
                    ```
                    It runs a provided side-effectful function on each element sequentially and returns a list of results.

                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Another important aspect to consider is potential errors and exceptions in the effectful code.

                    ```scala
                    val fail: IO[Nothing] = { () =>
                        throw new RuntimeExceptions("no code is executed after me")
                    }
                    ```

                    Like in ordinary imperative code, exceptions stop the computation chain and return early.

                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    (for {
                        _ <- putStrLn("Hello")
                        _ <- fail
                        _ <- putStrLn("world")
                    } yield ()).impureCompute()
                    ```

                <section data-markdown>
                    Let's suppose we want to catch errors and introduce additional logic.

                    We can introduce an attempt function which returns an infallible computation with Try in result.

                    ```scala
                    def attempt[T](
                        computation: IO[T],
                    ): IO[Try[T]] = { () =>
                        Try(computation.impureCompute())
                    }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    (for {
                        _ <- putStrLn("Hello")
                        result <- attempt(fail)
                        _ <- result match {
                          case Success(i) => putStrLn("world")
                          case Failure(throwable) =>
                            putStrLn("I failed with: " + throwable)
                        }
                      } yield ()).impureCompute()
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    We can also handle errors partially using a PartialFunction

                    ```scala
                    def catchErrors[T](computation: IO[T])(
                        handler: PartialFunction[Throwable, IO[T]],
                        ): IO[T] = attempt(computation).flatMap {
                            case Success(i) => IO.pure(i)
                            case Failure(throwable)
                            if handler.isDefinedAt(throwable) =>
                                handler(throwable)
                            case Failure(throwable) => throw throwable
                        }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    Finally, let's implement end of the world

                    ```scala
                    abstract class IOApp {
 
                        def run(args: Array[String]): IO[Unit]
                       
                        final def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
                          run(args).impureCompute()
                    }
                    ```
                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ```scala
                    object Main extends IOApp {
                        def printTwice(line: String): IO[Unit] =
                          for {
                            userInput <- getStrLn
                            _ <- putStrLn(line)
                            _ <- putStrLn(userInput)
                          } yield ()
                       
                        def run(args: Array[String]): IO[Unit] =
                          printTwice("Hello!")
                    }
                    ```
